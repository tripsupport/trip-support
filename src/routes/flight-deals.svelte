					Edmonton is North America’s most northernmost city. Despite being the administrative
					capital of the Alberta Province, it is second to Calgary in size. But that doesn’t mean it
					is a small city by any means. For the longest time, it has been the hub of northern and
					central Alberta’s oil and gas industry. Its oil sand reserves are only second to those of
					Saudi Arabia, which explains why most of the region’s economic activity involves
					petroleum, tourism, and agriculture. There is also a blossoming technology sector that
					cashes in on Canada’s premier reduction and research credentials. All of that aside, it is
					the friendly nature of the people of Edmonton that makes it a must-visit place.

					Edmonton is a town built by immigrants. The earliest groups of people came from as far as
					eastern Europe, with the most notable being the Chinese railway builders. The historical
					factors that attracted people to Edmonton in the past—employment and business
					opportunities, are the same reasons people move here today. From a small town, it has
					grown to a multicultural society of over a million people.

					Before the arrival of the Europeans in the 19th century, archaeological evidence suggests
					that Edmonton was a settlement for different aboriginal tribes. After the European
					settlement, the main catchment activity was fur trading with two companies, the Hudson’s
					Bay Company and the North West Company, carrying the bulk of the trade. Shortly after the
					Canadian government bought it out, infrastructure like railways made it an agricultural
					distribution hub, but it’s what happened in the 20th century that defines the city today.
					Having initially served as a military staging ground during the wars, it was the discovery
					of petroleum in Leduc that would change the city’s fortunes.

					Edmonton enjoys a humid continental climate. The seasonal temperatures tend to be extreme,
					but it’s unlike what you will experience in the neighboring cities of Winnipeg or Regina.
					In summers expect the highs to sometimes exceed 86 °F (30 °C), and in winters, the mercury
					can sometimes drop beyond -4 °F (-20 °C). These seasonal extremes notwithstanding, you
					will have plenty of sun in Edmonton, with sun hours reaching approximately seventeen and a
					quarter-hour in the summer solstice. Winters here last from November to March, while
					summers stretch from the last weeks of June to late august. The other seasons are
					relatively short and variable.

					In Edmonton, the first place people visit is the massive West Edmonton Mall for recreation
					shopping and business. But if the mall is not your thing, you will love the experience of
					Edmonton scenery from the many parks in the city. The most popular one is the Fort
					Edmonton park, but you could go to Elk Island National Park for kayaking, hiking, skating,
					cycling, and to see substantial American Bison. As a city of festivals, Sir Winston
					Churchill Square is where you catch most of them.

					If your visit coincides with K-days, Sourdough Raft Races, the Edmonton International
					Fringe Festival, and many others feel free to join in, you won’t be disappointed. For the
					arts and culture lovers, The Art Gallery of Alberta is a great start, but you could find
					more like the TELUS World of Science or Alberta Aviation Museum. You can also find
					theatres in the Old Strathcona district or other performing arts around the city. Lastly,
					(definitely not least) your taste buds will thank you if you grab local delicacies from
					the many food trucks, pop-up joints, and fine dining establishments all over the city.

					Edmonton International Airport (EIA) is the major transport hub in Edmonton. Despite there
					being several places to land smaller planes and even bush planes, the International port
					connects you to major cities across the world. Several major and budget airlines operate
					from it, and you can find flights to pretty much most of Canada from here.
