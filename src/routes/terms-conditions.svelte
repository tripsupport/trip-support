						</p>
						<p>
							Payment can be made in full via credit card, VISA Debit or Debit Mastercard,
							e-transfer to the address provided at the time of purchase, cash delivered to the Trip
							Support office, or wire transfer (in which case additional fees may apply).
							Additionally, U.S. customers may choose to pay by Zelle™.
						</p>
						<p>
							Alternatively, select purchases may be paid for in installments according to an
							installment plan determined at the time of purchase. To be eligible for this “Book
							Now, Pay Later” payment structure, the departure date associated with the product
							being purchased must be at least twenty-two (22) calendar days from the purchase date.
							Installments can be paid via VISA Debit, Debit Mastercard, e-transfer to the address
							provided at the time of purchase, cash delivered to the Trip Support office, or wire

							pay instalments via the Automated Clearing House network, Venmo™ or Zelle™.
						</p>
						<p>
							Users are responsible for the accuracy of their billing information. In the event that
							we are unable to verify the billing information provided, your purchase may not be
							processed. No compensation will be available in the event of a price increase and/or
							missed installment payment as a result of incomplete or inaccurate billing information
							provided by the User.
						</p>
						<p>
							By completing your purchase, you authorize Trip Support to process the reservation of
							your purchased product, with the relevant third-party supplier, on your behalf.
						</p>
						<p>All applicable taxes are charged and collected at the time of purchase.</p>
						<p>
							In the event of a price update in the period between a User’s browsing of the Websites
							and the completion of a purchase, the price displayed on the purchase page will
							prevail. Partial refunds as compensation for the reduction of the price of a product
							following a purchase are not available.
						</p>
						<p>
							Upon receipt of payment, you will receive an email with confirmation of your purchase
							and details of your payment for your records. All purchases are subject to
							availability at the time the purchase is completed. An e-mail confirmation confirms
							that the product has been successfully reserved for you. Purchasers are responsible
							for reviewing the information contained within the e-mail for accuracy and immediately
							contacting us in the event of an error.
						</p>
						<p>
							Additional fees, including but not limited to baggage fees and seat selection fees, if
							not expressly included in the purchase price, may apply and may be paid to the
							supplier at a later date. You are encouraged to carefully review a product’s
							inclusions before completing your purchase.
						</p>
						<p>
							By completing a purchase, you agree to the terms and conditions of the tour
							company/operator, airline, cruise line, car or hotel or other supplier providing the
							product you are purchasing. These terms and conditions are made available during the
							purchase process.
						</p>
						<p>
							Further, cancellation and refund availability is governed by each product’s terms and
							conditions, as displayed to the purchaser at the time of purchase. Any refund
							restriction applies equally to purchasers who chose at the time of purchase to pay in
							installments. In the event that a product’s terms and conditions preclude a refund,
							these purchasers will be bound to make any and all remaining instalment . Changes to
							reservations are also governed by the product’s terms and conditions. Change fees may
							apply and may be owed to one or both of Trip Support and the Supplier.
